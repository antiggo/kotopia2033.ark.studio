                        <p>A creative world that continues to evolve through others. It’s not meant to stay small or personal, but to become a cultural space that grows naturally across art, community, and technology.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>A World That Belongs to Everyone</strong>
                            Kotopia should be open for interpretation — people can draw it, remix it, or use it in their own way. The goal is for the world to feel collective and alive, not owned by a single person or company.
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            ”I want Koto to make everybody feel like there is an opportunity.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Expanding Through Culture, Not Marketing</strong>
                            Future growth will come through cultural presence — collaborations, events, and creative communities — instead of advertising or corporate partnerships. The aim is for Kotopia to spread “organically,” through shared curiosity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>An Ecosystem That Grows Itself</strong>
                            The world of Kotopia is meant to feel both deeply personal and globally relatable — blending aesthetics and emotions from different cultures without losing authenticity or warmth.
                        </p>

                            <strong>Not About Approval or Performance</strong>
                            Creative fulfillment doesn’t come from recognition or numbers, but from sincerity and the internal drive to make something that feels alive. No chasing relevance or external approval, or comparing to the hollow, performative side of online culture.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Not Corporate</strong>
                            “It’s not like a company, it’s more like… like a world. It’s more like a feeling that people can enter.”

                        <p>
                            “It doesn’t have to be concentrated on you as a character… It’s more like they are the hero in the story, and there’s this mascot that helps them create their own story.”

                        <p>
                            <strong>not merch-centered</strong>
                            “I do like I want to tell people I make toys and like I sell… a game… as opposed to like hey, I have this drop this month it’s gonna sell out you better be ready for the website…”
